The middleware is being designed for a very responsive user experience, minimum copy transfer of buffers along playback/record pipelines, high performance playback of multiple contents in several video windows and content security. The middleware was driven by of JSON APIs routed from from a mini web server.",

The software has several features like HTML5 UI with webkit/QT, homenetworking, DVR, content protection, DRM and playback on 2nd screenslike iPads etc. Software is deployed on a Broadcom SoC with Liberty Global inPoland and Czech republic. Worked on EOS flavor of this productwhich is going to be deployed in some countries in Europe by end of this year. Worked on optimizing the stack for low latency wrt resource management and channel changes. Also worked on leading a team of developers towards development of software components for headless gateway product for home networking with new Intel Chipsets.Â The middleware was driven by of JSON APIs routed from from a mini web server.",
